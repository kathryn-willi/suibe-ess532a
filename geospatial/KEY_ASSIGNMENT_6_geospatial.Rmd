## Instructions

In this assignment, you will analyze temperature data for China using the *same techniques* we learned with precipitation data. You have been provided with two temperature raster files:

- `china_historic_temp.tiff` - Historic mean annual temperature (1970-2000) in degrees Celsius
- `china_2050_temp.tiff` - Projected mean annual temperature (2041-2060) in degrees Celsius

Complete the following tasks using R and the geospatial packages we learned about in class.

---

## Setup

Make sure you have loaded all necessary packages:

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(tmap)
library(rnaturalearth)
```

Load the spatial objects we created in class:

```{r load-spatial-data}
# Load China boundary data
china_mainland <- ne_countries(country = "China", returnclass = "sf", scale = "medium")
china_provinces <- ne_states(country = "China", returnclass = "sf")

# Create cities dataset
chinese_cities <- data.frame(
  city_name = c("Beijing", "Shanghai", "Guangzhou", "Shenzhen", 
                "Chengdu", "Hangzhou", "Xi'an", "Wuhan", 
                "Nanjing", "Tianjin"),
  longitude = c(116.4074, 121.4737, 113.2644, 114.0579,
                104.0668, 120.1551, 108.9480, 114.3054,
                118.7969, 117.1901),
  latitude = c(39.9042, 31.2304, 23.1291, 22.5431,
               30.6728, 30.2741, 34.3416, 30.5928,
               32.0603, 39.1255),
  population_millions = c(21.9, 24.9, 18.8, 17.8,
                         21.4, 8.6, 9.22, 8.99,
                         10.17, 14.7)
)

# Convert to spatial data
cities_sf <- st_as_sf(chinese_cities, 
                      coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                      crs = 4326)
```

## Load Temperature Raster Data

Load both temperature raster files using the `rast()` function:


```{r load-temperature-data}
# Load temperature raster data
china_temp_hist <- rast("data/china_historic_temp.tiff")
china_temp_2050 <- rast("data/china_2050_temp.tiff")

```

---

## Question 1: Visualize Historic Temperature (5 points)

Create a map showing historic temperature across China. Your map should:
- Convert the raster to a data frame for plotting
- Use `geom_raster()` to display temperature values
- Add the mainland China country boundary as an overlay
- Include appropriate color scale and labels
- Use `scale_fill_distiller()` and the "RdYlBu" palette to make the colors more appropriate for viewing temperature data.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r historic-temperature-map}
# Convert raster to data frame for ggplot
temp_hist_df <- as.data.frame(china_temp_hist, xy = TRUE)

# Create map
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = temp_hist_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = China_historic_temp)) + 
  geom_sf(data = china_mainland, fill = NA, color = "black", size = 1) +
  scale_fill_distiller(name = "Temperature\n(°C)", palette = "RdYlBu") +
  labs(title = "China Historic Temperature (1970-2000)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


---

## Question 2: Calculate Temperature Change (5 points)

Calculate the projected change in temperature between 2050 and historic. Call the new raster object "temp_change" and use `plot()` to view it.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r calculate-temperature-change}
# Calculate temperature change
temp_change <- china_temp_2050 - china_temp_hist

# Create basic plot
plot(temp_change, main = "Projected Temperature Change (2050 - Historic)")
```

---

## Question 3: Extract Temperature Data for Cities (5 points)

Extract the projected temperature change values for all major Chinese cities using the `extract()` function and add this information as a new column in the `cities_sf` dataset:

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r extract-city-temperatures}
# Extract temperature change values for cities
cities_temp <- cities_sf %>%
  mutate(temp_change = terra::extract(temp_change, cities_sf)$China_2050_temp)

# View the results
print("Cities with temperature change data:")
cities_temp
```

Create a map showing cities sized by their projected temperature change:

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r cities-temperature-map}
# Map cities sized by temperature change
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = china_mainland, fill = "lightgray", color = "black") +
  geom_sf(data = cities_temp, aes(size = temp_change), 
          color = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Temperature\nChange (°C)", 
                       range = c(2, 8)) + 
  labs(title = "Chinese Cities: Projected Temperature Change (2050)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Which cities are projected to experience the greatest temperature increases? List the top 3 and their approximate temperature changes.

## Question 4: Provincial Temperature Analysis (5 points)

Calculate the mean projected temperature change for each province using the `zonal()` function. Add the values as a new column to your china_provices data.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r provincial-temperature-analysis}
# Calculate zonal statistics for provinces
provinces_temp <- china_provinces %>%
  mutate(temp_change = terra::zonal(temp_change, vect(china_provinces), 
                                   fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE)$China_2050_temp) %>%
  select(name, temp_change)

# View results
print("Provincial temperature changes:")
head(provinces_temp)
```

Create a map showing provinces colored by their projected temperature change:

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r provincial-temperature-map}
# Map provinces by temperature change
ggplot(provinces_temp) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = temp_change), color = "white", size = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Temperature\nChange (°C)") +
  labs(title = "Projected Temperature Change by Province (2050)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Which provinces are projected to warm the most and least?

## Bonus Task: Change Correlations (2 extra credit points)

Join the *provinces_precip* dataset we created togther in class with the similar *provinces_temp* dataset (or whatever you named it) you created in this assignment and create a scatter plot that shows the relationship between change in precipitation and change in temperature. What trends do you see?

Notes:
- To use any of the dplyr join functions (such as `left_join()`) you will first need to convert *provinces_precip* and your new *provinces_temp* object from an sf object to a data frame. You can do this with the `st_drop_geometry()` function.

```{r bonus-task}
# Your bonus code here (if attempting)

```

```{r}
precip_df <- st_drop_geometry(provinces_precip)
temp_df <- st_drop_geometry(provinces_temp)

joined_data <- left_join(precip_df, temp_df, by = "name")

# create the scatter plot
ggplot(joined_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = temp_change, y = precip_change))
```
